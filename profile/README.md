# AI Leadership
The AI Leadership team consists of two related projects

  * [FishNet](https://github.com/SVVSDICAI/fishNET-documentation) - using a custom underwater camera solution and ai backend to count local fish populations
  * Critter Cam - using CuddeBack game cameras to capture images of terrestrial animals, moving towards creating a database of animal pictures to train a classification model

The team works with partners in [the City of Longmont](https://www.longmontcolorado.gov/departments/departments-n-z/parks-open-space-trails) and [Boulder County Parks and Open Space](https://bouldercounty.gov/departments/parks-and-open-space/).

The FishNet project was awarded 1st place in the [WAICY 2022 High School Division](https://www.waicy.org/waicy-2022-welcome/).
